# Specimen Skeleton Support

These are tools used by the [Specimen Skeleton](https://github.com/kabisa/specimen-skeleton) to generate all the font data needed by the skeleton.

This repo is separated from the Specimen Skeleton boilerplate, as the boilerplate is meant to be cloned as template. This way we can update the shared code, so Specimen Skeleton users will always have access to the latest tooling.


## Tests

We got tests! Run 'em by running `yarn test`.
